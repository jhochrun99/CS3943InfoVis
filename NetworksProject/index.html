            <h1>Visualization 1</h1>
            <p>
                Create an overview of the relationships between countries so that it is possible to see who donates to whom and how much.
            </p>
            <ul><li>Who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most and how much?</li>
                <li>Who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive from the most and how much?</li>
                <li>We only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors over time for this question.</li>
            </ul>
            <div id="vis1"></div>
            <p>
                The donors and recipients are sorted by overall net donation values. 
                <br>The United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the major donors. 
                <br>India, Thailand, and Brazil are the major receivers. 
                <br>The single largest donation was from Japan to India. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Visualization 2</h1>
            <p>
                Consider only the top 5 purposes of donation, and the top 10 recipients and top 20 donors.
            </p>
            <ul><li>How does the relationship between countries look in terms of purposes?</li>
                <li>What composition of purposes do the donations between each pair of countries have?</li>
                <li>Are there countries that donate to a given country using multiple purposes? Or do counties always donate using one single purpose when donating to another country?</li>
            </ul>
            <div id="visLegend2"></div>
            <div id="vis2"></div>   
            <br>
            <p>
                The United States makes a lot of different types of donations to each country. Japan starts off with having
                varied donation purposes, but then focuses on donations for rail transport and industrial development. 
                <br>Overall, there are a lot of donations for industrial development. 
                <br><br> I considered making area relevant for this visualization as well, and showing the net amount of donations
                through the size of the pie chart, but varying the sizes of the circles made it much harder to see the different
                colors and compare donation purposes, especially since the circles are already on the smaller side to fit them all 
                on the screen.
