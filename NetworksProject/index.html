                Create an overview of the relationships between countries so that it is possible to see who donates to whom and how much.

            <ul><li>Who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most and how much?</li>
                <li>Who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive from the most and how much?</li>

                Consider only the top 5 purposes of donation, and the top 10 recipients and top 20 donors.

                <li>What composition of purposes do the donations between each pair of countries have?</li>
                <li>Are there countries that donate to a given country using multiple purposes? Or do counties always donate using one single purpose when donating to another country?</li>
