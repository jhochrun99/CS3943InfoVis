            <p>How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and donate from other countries? 
               <br>Are there countries that donate much more than they receive or receive much more than they donate?</p>

            <h1>Visualization 2</h1>
            <p>Do the countries that mostly receive or mostly donate tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world? 
                <br>Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive 
                vs. how much they donate?</p>
