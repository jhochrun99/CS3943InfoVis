            <h1>Visualization 1</h1>
            <p>How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and donate from other countries? 
               <br>Are there countries that donate much more than they receive or receive much more than they donate?</p>
            <div id="vis1"></div>
            <br><p>The countries that receive significantly more aid than they give are India,
                Thailand, and Brazil. The countries that give significantly more aid than they 
                receive are the United States of America, Japan, and Germany. 
                <br><br>There are a few countries in the center as well, that give and receive 
                roughly the same amount, causing them to have either no visible bar or a very small 
                bar. A few of these are Portugal, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Monaco. 
            </p>

            <h1>Visualization 2</h1>
            <p>Do the countries that mostly receive or mostly donate tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world? 
                <br>Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive 
                vs. how much they donate?</p>
            <div id="visLegend"></div>
            <div id="vis2"></div>
            <p>As can be seen on the map, the majority of countries that are near each other
                fall into similar donation habits. The largest differences would be between 
                the United States and Canada, and Korea and Japan. The US and Canada are both
                red, meaning they donate more than they receive, but Canada is a much lighter
                red. For Korea and Japan, Korea is a light blue and Japan is a dark red, so 
                Korea receives slightly more aid, and Japan gives significantly more donations. 
                <br><br> A small difference can be seen in Europe as well. Poland is blue, it
                receives more aid than it gives, and Germany is red. Both are light compared
                to countries like the US and India, but they're darker than the surrounding
                European countries. 
                <br><br>Looking at South America, the countries there are mostly blue. The only 
                exception is French Guiana, which is being considered as part of France anyway,
                and it's a very light red.
